gipfel ChangeLog
=================

gipfel-0.2.3
 - Fix a major shortcoming in the rectilinear projection
   code. This improves accuracy quite a bit, mostly in
   wideangle images.

gipfel-0.2.2
 - Fix a segfault if exif tool is not installed.
 - Some optimizations.
 - Don't make view window larger than the screen.
 - Add command line oprtions for data export.
 - Add visibility command line option.
 - Reset known hills when loading new image.
 - Cancel "Choose Hill" dialog on Esc.
 - Make code -Wall clean.

gipfel-0.2.1
 - Fix compilation problem.
 - Replace bilinear with bicubic interpolation in stitching mode (-b option).
 - Improve usability of "Choose Viewpoint" dialog.
   Up/Down/Return now do what one would expect.
 - Improve lens distortion correction.
   Horizontal main point offsets are taken into account now.
 - Ask before overwriting existing lens profiles.
 - Update alpinkoordinaten.dat datafile.

gipfel-0.2.0
 - Change scale factor to "focal length in 35mm" this makes it 
   independent of the image size. One can now scale an already 
   oriented image without invalidating the orientation information.
 - gipfel now tries to find a reasonable default for the scale value
   when opening new images based on the "Focal Length In 35mm" Exif 
   tag, if it exists.
 - GPS Exif tags are used if they exist.
 - gipfel can now correct lens distortion (see README).
 - Switched to use maxima for symbolic computation and code generation.
 - Switched to use th GNU Scientific Library instead of ccmath.
 - Major simplifications of the projection code.
 - Removed the "guess" button.
 - Added bilinear interpolation for image stitching (-b option).
 - Added range option (-r) for image stitching.
 - Known mountains must now be marked with the middle mouse button
   and positioned by dragging them with the left button pressed.

gipfel-0.1.3
 - Add stitching mode (gipfel -s). See README  for details.
 - Update datafile from http://www.alpin-koordinaten.de
 - Fix various bugs.

gipfel-0.1.2
 - Fix bugs for "Normal Projection" and "Panoramic Projection" mode.
   Panorama mode now works with the great view from Mount Everest by
   Roddy Mackenzie (google for mackenzie everest panorama).
 - Add variable width display of GPS tracks (depending on the distance).
 - Add heuristics for hidden object detection.
 - Switch to fltk "plastic" scheme as it looks better.

gipfel-0.1.1
 - Don't try to display invisible trackpoints.
 - Fix bug in "Normal Projection" code for wide angle images.
 - Avoid complete redraw when moving mountains to reduce flicker.

gipfel-0.1.0
 - Display of GPS-tracks.
   GPS-tracks e.g. those that can be downloaded from www.alpin-koordinaten.de
   ("Fugawi 3 TXT" format) or self-recored ones, can be projected 
   on your digital images!
 - Load/save perspective data from/to JPEG comment section.
   This means, that you can create and share "gipfel-enabled" images. 
   Whenever you want, you can use these images and e.g. display your 
   GPS-tracks on them, without further fiddling to find the view parameters.
 - Experimental support for panorama images.
   gipfel can now handle images with panoramic projection. Check the
   "Options" menu entry.
 - Data file from www.alpin-koordinaten.de
   With the kind permission of the guys from www.alpin-koordinaten.de, the
   gipfel tarball now contains a default datafile with more than 6000 entries
   from around the world.
 - Duplicate GPS entry elimation.
 - Show parameter values in control window.
   No need to choose your viewpoint on the commandline. Use the new 
   "peak-choosing" widget to find your viewpoint interactively.
 - Choose viewpoint via GUI.
 - Improved label placement.

gipfel-0.0.1
 - Initial version.
