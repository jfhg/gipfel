* Add manual hiding / unhiding from right click popup menu.
* Moved NEWS to ChangeLog.

gipfel-0.3.1
* Fix compile error and warnings on Linux.

gipfel-0.3.0
* Use exiv2 library for image metadata reading and writing.
  (initial patch by Konrad Golling).
* Make gipfel compile on [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* Check for files in local tarball to make gipfel work without
  installing it.
* Don't exit on Escape.

gipfel-0.2.9
* Add rpm spec file.
* fsync() temporary file before rename().
* Add "Find Peak" dialog (right click on image).
* Show height in search dialog to distinguish peaks with equal names.
* Added "File->Screen Dump" feature.
* Improved label placing.
* Fix long standing bug with panoramic projection if one known peak
  is "left" and one is "right" of north.

gipfel-0.2.8
* Fix issue with image saving on some platforms (reported by David Mitchell).
* Fix crash in stitching mode.
* Add a note to the README about generating a data file for the USA from
  [USGS](http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm) data
  (pointed out by David Mitchell).

gipfel-0.2.7
* Import data from http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/ with the
  kind permission of Jonathan de Ferranti. Thanks a lot!
  This brings the number of peaks in the default data file to
  more than 21000!
* Change display style a bit and reduce font size to make room
  for all the new peaks from the updated data file.
* Show height and distance of the peak which is currently under
  the mouse.

gipfel-0.2.6
* Improve image saving. It is now possible to overwrite the current
  image file.
* Install README and NEWS file to $PREFIX/share/doc/gipfel/.
* Change semantics of -t option.
  -t now requires a file just as -j does.
  To generate multiple TIFF files as input to enblend, just do
  for i in *.jpg; do gipfel -s -b -t tiff/$i $i; done
  This simplifies the code and allows to parallelize stitching on
  multicore systems.
* Add simple README viewer to the Help menu.

gipfel-0.2.5
* Improved stitching speed.
* Fixed a bug with tiff file generation in stitching mode.
* Updated README file.

gipfel-0.2.4
* Fix another issue in the rectilinear projection code
   that affected non-horizontally shot pictures.
* Use a more robust forumla for spherical distance computation.
* Take refraction effect into account.

gipfel-0.2.3
* Fix a major shortcoming in the rectilinear projection
   code. This improves accuracy quite a bit, mostly in
   wideangle images.

gipfel-0.2.2
* Fix a segfault if exif tool is not installed.
* Some optimizations.
* Don't make view window larger than the screen.
* Add command line oprtions for data export.
* Add visibility command line option.
* Reset known hills when loading new image.
* Cancel "Choose Hill" dialog on Esc.
* Make code -Wall clean.

gipfel-0.2.1
* Fix compilation problem.
* Replace bilinear with bicubic interpolation in stitching mode (-b option).
* Improve usability of "Choose Viewpoint" dialog.
   Up/Down/Return now do what one would expect.
* Improve lens distortion correction.
   Horizontal main point offsets are taken into account now.
* Ask before overwriting existing lens profiles.
* Update alpinkoordinaten.dat datafile.

gipfel-0.2.0
* Change scale factor to "focal length in 35mm" this makes it 
   independent of the image size. One can now scale an already 
   oriented image without invalidating the orientation information.
* gipfel now tries to find a reasonable default for the scale value
   when opening new images based on the "Focal Length In 35mm" Exif 
   tag, if it exists.
* GPS Exif tags are used if they exist.
* gipfel can now correct lens distortion (see README).
* Switched to use maxima for symbolic computation and code generation.
* Switched to use th GNU Scientific Library instead of ccmath.
* Major simplifications of the projection code.
* Removed the "guess" button.
* Added bilinear interpolation for image stitching (-b option).
* Added range option (-r) for image stitching.
* Known mountains must now be marked with the middle mouse button
   and positioned by dragging them with the left button pressed.

gipfel-0.1.3
* Add stitching mode (gipfel*s). See README  for details.
* Update datafile from http://www.alpin-koordinaten.de
* Fix various bugs.

gipfel-0.1.2
* Fix bugs for "Normal Projection" and "Panoramic Projection" mode.
   Panorama mode now works with the great view from Mount Everest by
   Roddy Mackenzie (google for mackenzie everest panorama).
* Add variable width display of GPS tracks (depending on the distance).
* Add heuristics for hidden object detection.
* Switch to fltk "plastic" scheme as it looks better.

gipfel-0.1.1
* Don't try to display invisible trackpoints.
* Fix bug in "Normal Projection" code for wide angle images.
* Avoid complete redraw when moving mountains to reduce flicker.

gipfel-0.1.0
* Display of GPS-tracks.
   GPS-tracks e.g. those that can be downloaded from www.alpin-koordinaten.de
   ("Fugawi 3 TXT" format) or self-recored ones, can be projected 
   on your digital images!
* Load/save perspective data from/to JPEG comment section.
   This means, that you can create and share "gipfel-enabled" images. 
   Whenever you want, you can use these images and e.g. display your 
   GPS-tracks on them, without further fiddling to find the view parameters.
* Experimental support for panorama images.
   gipfel can now handle images with panoramic projection. Check the
   "Options" menu entry.
* Data file from www.alpin-koordinaten.de
   With the kind permission of the guys from www.alpin-koordinaten.de, the
   gipfel tarball now contains a default datafile with more than 6000 entries
   from around the world.
* Duplicate GPS entry elimation.
* Show parameter values in control window.
   No need to choose your viewpoint on the commandline. Use the new 
   "peak-choosing" widget to find your viewpoint interactively.
* Choose viewpoint via GUI.
* Improved label placement.

gipfel-0.0.1
* Initial version.
